## Running the tests
Code is covered by an RSpec suite and Cucumber feature definitions.
Some examples require a *live* environment consisting of:

* A network connection
* [Selenium Server](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2) listening on port 4444
* [beanstalkd](http://kr.github.io/beanstalkd/) listening on port 11300

In order to run all examples including live ones, execute:

```
$ rake test:live
```

In order to run all examples excluding live ones, execute:

```
$ rake test
```
