# `Page` objects

Retrieved pages are represented by `Page` objects and made accessible by `#page` within actions. `Page`s support the same set of features regardless of the HTTP adapter in use.

<aside class="note">
HTTP response headers and status codes are not supported by Selenium WebDrivers. Wayfarer emulates both by having the WebDriver fire an AJAX request to the current page and extracting them from the response. Clearly this is a hack, but it might even work for you. See <a href="https://github.com/bauerd/selenium-emulated_features">selenium-emulated_features</a>.
</aside>

<aside class="note">
Even after having followed redirects, <code>Page#uri</code> always returns the URI that originally initiated the redirects. This behaviour stems from redirects being opaque to WebDrivers.

A `Page` brings to the table all you'd wish for when doing web scraping:

* [Nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org) parses HTML/XML
* [Oj](https://github.com/ohler55/oj) parses JSON
* [Pismo](https://github.com/peterc/pismo) lets you access metadata, e.g. keywords, author, a summary, â€¦

Let's see it in action:

{% highlight ruby %}
class DummyJob < Wayfarer::Job
  draw uri: "https://example.com"
  def example
    page # => #<Wayfarer::Page:...>

    page.uri # => #<URI::...>
    page.status_code # => Fixnum
    page.body # => String
    page.headers # => Hash

    page.doc # => #<Nokogiri::HTML::Document:...>

    page.links # => [URI]
    page.stylesheets # => [URI]
    page.javascripts # => [URI]
    page.images # => [URI]

    # All previous four methods accept arbitrary many CSS selectors
    page.links ".my-target", ".my-other-target"

    # The following methods get forwarded to a Pismo::Document
    # See https://github.com/peterc/pismo
    page.title
    page.titles
    page.author
    page.lede
    page.keywords
    page.sentences(qty)
    page.body
    page.html_body
    page.feed
    page.feeds
    page.favicon
    page.description
    page.datetime
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
